# How to open Javadoc
  - Basically clone this repo and then once you have it locally on your machine open the "docs" folder and then open the index.html in chrome and you will be able to see the Javadoc for my tests

 # Description of Tests
 2.1. User Story 1: Monitor Posted Questions
As a staff member, I need access to all user-submitted questions so I can evaluate their quality, ensure relevance, and catch any issues early on.

2.2. User Story 2: Evaluate Submitted Answers
As a staff member, I want to review user responses to verify that the information being shared is accurate, constructive, and adds value to our knowledge base.

2.3. User Story 3: Inspect Private Messages and Feedback
As a staff member, I’d like the ability to check private conversations or feedback between users to identify any signs of misuse or conflict and step in before it escalates.

2.4. User Story 4: Provide Feedback and Raise Flags
As a staff member, I want the tools to flag or leave comments on specific content—whether it’s a question, answer, or message—so I can alert the necessary parties for further evaluation or action.

2.5. User Story 5: Create Summary Interaction Reports
As a staff member, I want to be able to generate reports summarizing user activity, including questions, responses, and private feedback, so I can quickly identify patterns and collaborate with admins or instructors to foster a positive community environment.
